# Getting Started

1. `bundle`
2. `rake db:migrate`
3. `rake db:seed`
4. `rails s` and go to `localhost:3000`

## How it works

You will get redirect to `/orders/new`. Here there are two items that are being purchased. Adding a promo code that works such as `FIFTY` or `$10OFF` and clicking `Apply` will remove 50% of the total or remove $10 respectively.
